## 💡 About

**My Daily Brief** solves the problem of "tab fatigue." Instead of opening five different apps for weather, news, stocks, todos, and music, this application aggregates them all into a high-performance, dark-mode dashboard.

Powered by **Google Gemini AI**, it doesn't just show you data—it interprets it. It generates a witty executive summary of your morning, recommends outfits based on live weather patterns, and even analyzes the sentiment of your journal entries to give you life advice.

---

## �️ Tech Stack

*   **Core:** Python 3.9+ 🐍
*   **Web Framework:** Streamlit (Custom CSS & Components)
*   **AI Engine:** Google Gemini (2.5/2.0 Flash/Pro Fallback System) 🤖
*   **Data Visualization:** Plotly & Plotly Express 📊
*   **Financial Data:** yFinance (Yahoo Finance) 📈
*   **APIs:** OpenWeatherMap, NewsAPI, ExchangeRate-API

---

## ⚙️ Architecture & Flow

The application follows a **Data-Driven Retrieval & Generation (RAG-lite)** pipeline:

`User Input (City/Interactions)` ➡️ `State Management` ➡️ `Data Aggregation` ➡️ `AI Synthesis` ➡️ `UI Rendering`

1.  **Input Layer**: User selects city or types journal entry.
2.  **Orchestration**: `session_state` checks if data is cached (Lazy Loading).
3.  **Data Fetching**:
    *   *Weather Node*: Calls OpenWeatherMap API.
    *   *News Node*: Calls NewsAPI.
    *   *Market Node*: Calls yFinance.
4.  **AI Inference Layer (Gemini)**:
    *   *System*: Takes raw Weather + News data.
    *   *Prompt*: "Act as a personal assistant, generate witty summary."
    *   *Output*: Natural language briefing.
5.  **Presentation**: Custom CSS renders the "Neo-Dark" UI with Plotly charts.
